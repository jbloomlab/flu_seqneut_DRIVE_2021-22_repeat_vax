# Plasmid maps for all recent strains cloned for inclusion in sequencing-based neutralization assay library

- Files are named with strain name and a defined strain number, used for cloning purposes only
- Barcode sequences that were determined based on full plasmid sequencing by Primordium Labs are included in maps
- Each strain has multiple plasmid files, each plasmid file is designated with a barcode indicated by letters (i.e. A,B,C,D)
- Barcodes are included both in the genbank sequence and in the plasmid description

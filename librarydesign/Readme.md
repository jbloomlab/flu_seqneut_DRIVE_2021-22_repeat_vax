# The files contained in this directory were used to select strains for the sequencing-based neutralization assay. 
The following code was used to identify emerging clades https://github.com/nextstrain/augur/blob/master/scripts/identify_emerging_clades.py with at least 1 HA1 mutation present at at least 1% global frequency. 

### The following files input and output files are included:
 - The phylogenetic tree: flu_seasonal_h1n1pdm_ha_2y_2022-10-07.json
 - The tip frequencies data: flu_seasonal_h1n1pdm_ha_2y_2022-10-07-tip-frequencies.json
 - The selected clades, and link to visualize on current Nextstrain tree: h1n1pdm_ha_subclades_0.01_221012.html
 - Members of selected clades: h1n1pdm_ha_subclades_0.01_221012.tsv
 - Selected strains within emerging clades, and acknowledgements for GISAID contributers: selectedstrains_and_acknowledgements.txt
